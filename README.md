# BoneTool
BoneTool is a tool created to edit block properties with many features for builders. This is a creative tool developed as a package of features intended to be used on creative servers. 


Features:<br>
Use the wand to edit block properties<br>
Place blocks without triggering block updates<br>
Change your fly speed by double crouching<br>
Edit signs by right-clicking on them<br>
Automatically delete items when dropped<br>
Access to unobtainable items including portals, piston head, lit redstone lamps and more<br>
Place specific paintings rather than a random one<br>

Soft Depencies (fully optional):<br>
Builder's Utilities by Arcaniax. BoneTool will expand the existing /blocks menu. This can be disabled in the config file.<br>
LightAPI by EvilSpawn. This allows BoneTool to edit the light level of blocks. Must be turned on in the config file. This feature is obsolete thanks to light blocks being added in 1.17.<br>
