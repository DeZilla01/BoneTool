This is the BoneTool locale folder.
You can edit or create translations here.
If you wish to create a translation that does not exists, simply copy paste "en.yml" to "xx.yml", where xx represent the language code, 
and edit the sentences/words to your language.

You can change the language used by the plugin by changing the "defaultLocale" setting in config.yml to the language code of your choice.
You can also use "/bonetool locale" in-game to change the language for yourself.

If you do create a new translation, I would greatly appreciate your yml file so I can distribute it officially and allow other users to
enjoy your translation =D.
